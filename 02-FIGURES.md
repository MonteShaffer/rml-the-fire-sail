| Ed: |   Carla.  Please get up.  I need you to come with me.  We have to get Monte moved. |
| Carla: |   OK.  (standing up)  I asked him to stay by the stairwell over there.  (walking with Ed) |
| Ed: |   I understand today is a difficult day, but I need to be clear on one thing.  We need to proceed carefully with the explanation of what happened here.  Did Lana call you on the phone?  What exactly was said?  Did you say "I will leave now". |
| Carla: |   (thinks for a moment) No.  I said that I was in a dilemna waiting for David or Warren's parents.  Why?|
| Ed: |   Well, that is good to hear. (pause).  Listen, I need to be very clear.  We need to establish that you and Warren/Kandie were home when the fire occurred, the other children were at primary, including Monte.  You turned your back and Warren started the fire.  This is the best narrative considering the current situation.  |
| Carla: |   I don't understand.  Why not just tell the truth of what happened. |
| Ed: |   Carla.  I am sorry for what happened.  I am trying to help.  To clean this up, that has to be the story.  Otherwise there may be accusations of child abandonment and endangerment which could mean you would be charged with negligent manslaughter. |
| Carla: |   (resigned)  That figures!  Of course all of this means that I am a negligent man. |
| Carla: |   (approaching stairwell) Monte, why are you hiding there?  Come closer.  Ed is a friend and is here to help us (she looks at Ed skeptically). |
| Monte: |   (hugging mom, wheezing)  That mean woman from nursery that doesn't share her milk wanted me to get in her car, so I hid myself.  I don't like her.  And you told me to wait here.  |
| Carla: |   Good boy.  You did what Mama asked.  Now I am going to ask you to go with Ed and listen to him carefully.  I will see you very soon.  Okay son? |
| Ed: |   Monte.  I am going to wrap you in my firefighter coat and take you to my truck.  I will ask you to lay down in the backseat and be quiet.  If you hear anyone approach the truck, you need to be very quiet.  If your breathing is too heavy and wheezy, hold you breath for a moment.  There is a sandwich and some water.  In a little bit, Jean Wendt and her husband will take you and Michael to their home.  You will rest for a few days until your wheezing stops.  Do you understand? |
| Carla: |   Monte, remember Jean.  She is nice to you.  Did you listen carefully? |
| Monte: |   Yes mama.  I will pretend I am playing 'hide and seek' - quiet as a mouse.  By mama, I will see you soon. I love you mama! (turning to Ed)  OK, I am ready.  |
| Carla: |   (whispers, tearfully) I love you too son.  (begins sobbing uncontrollably as Ed carries Monte to his truck) |

###(RING!, 4:05PM)[^1]

| :--------------------------- | :------  |
| Carla: |   Hello?   | 
| Lana: |   Carla, it's 4:05PM and your children are still here at the Church [^2].  You know the rules.  | 
| Carla:    |  Hi Lana [^3].  Thanks for letting me know.  David was supposed to pick them up at 4.  Is he not there yet?   | 
| Lana: |  Would I be calling if he was here!   | 
| Carla: |   You're right, sorry.  I can pick them up in a few minutes when Warren's mom shows up.  I just put Kandie down for a nap.   | 
| Lana: |   Do you think I want to hear your life story?  You know the rules.  The primary program is a benefit to you and your children, but they must be picked up by 4PM.  It is now 4:06 and you are no closer to getting here.   | 
| Carla: |   But, I can't leave the house yet.  | 
| Lana: |  I will not repeat myself.  If you are not here by 4:15PM, your children won't participate in this afterschool program again.  Do you hear me!   |

###(TOREN HOME, 4:17PM)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Lana: |  Ed, where are you?   | 
| Ed: |  I have a fire call!  Out on Tamarack Lane.  It may be the Shaffer home.   | 
| Lana: |  Carla's house is on fire?!?  I just got off the phone with her.  She was late picking up the oldest kids from primary.   | 
| Ed (exasperated): |  Lana, what did you do?   | 

###(Awkward Pause)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Ed (decisive): |  It doesn't matter now.  But you should probably follow me to the house in your car.  The kids shouldn't be there.  Maybe take them to the Kiser's.  I got to go.  Like Now! |





[^1]: The call was likely a connection on a party line.  How the connection was actually made, and which parties were listening are uncertain.  The call will be framed after the minutiae of the connection is executed.
