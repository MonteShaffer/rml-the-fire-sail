# Introduction to "The Fire Sail"
It is almost 1PM in Kalispell on 14 November 2024, and I just finished my first "therapy session" regarding grief acceptance with Melanie.  Over the next few weeks, she will coach me and guide me to face my unresolved traumas associated with March 1, 1977.  As she stated, "you seem to have death as triggers of significant mania events."  Maybe so.  Let's explore this.

I suggested that I wanted to develop a memoir to enable my family on their own path of healing, and to leave a marker for my son Alexander when he is older and wants to understand his daddy. [I left my cusion on the free bus!]

The memoir is for the Fab 4 directly involved with the family fire that occurred on March 1, 1977 at 1610 (20?) Tamarack Lane.

For:  Kandie, Warren, Carla, and me
