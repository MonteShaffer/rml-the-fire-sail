Journal for "Grief Recovery" Handbook: Intro - Chapter 1

Honestly, I was quite underwhelmed by the content up to and including Chapter 1.  The number of illogical statements makes me a bit concerned about this approach.  However, I agreed with Greg that trying many different therapy approaches may be beneficial to me, so I do commit to give it a "college try".  The upside is that two men are going to try and "mansplain" using the "heart over mind" to approach grief.  This is my anchor of hope for this book.

Fundamentally, the book and its approach seems to be a love child between a cult religion and an Amway-like sales approach.  Let me explain.

Ironically, the first part is called "seeing the problem" which I fully do.  The problem with the handbook and its approach.

- Two men faced grief in 1977 and thereafter: one faced the death of a child and the other faced a divorce.  The first man apparently was selling his product of grief reconciliation that the second man attended and was sold:  hook, line, and sinker.  So for 21 years, he has been a subservient follower (or first disciple) of the first man.
- First written in 1988 or so, this book was en par with many self-help programs that had a book and a regime to follow.  The most famous would likely be the work of Stephen R Covey with his "7 habits" and his merger with Franklin to develop a Franklin/Covey daily organizer planner.  The difference between these two groups however, is that Stephen R Covey had developed his ideas in both an academic and a business domain.  This group of James/Friedman were literally just the story of "one man" proselyting his solution to the world.  

- First published as a free e-book, then updated in 1988.
- Special recognition to thousands of grieving people who shared letters and calls.  Curated by the "boss man" and changes implemented as he saw fit.
- Oh look, a reprint can provide updates (and more sales).  1988, 1998, 2008, ... and the local IF library says that 2014 is on the way.  Which means, the library will purchase this newest version and discard the previous version (the 2008 version is the one I am reading).  
- If I really wanted to understand the thought process of this "one man" who has the only true and living secret formula for grieving success, I would do a longitudinal textual analysis of the 3 (soon to be 4) texts.  What changed, and why?
- These men faced the generational manufactured trauma of JFK.  And since then, shared in the similar trauma of 9-11.  So there may be valuable updates.  However, they are one generation away from me, so I would want someone who is a Gen-X or younger to TELL ME how to GRIEVE PROPERLY.

- New material includes emphasis on boss-man's original idea:  "with correct information and correct choices, a person can recover from any significant loss."  There is a lot to unpack there, but it is the essence of the distilled TRUTH that I am approaching an Amway cult.  

Men like to be very binary:  you recovered from your grief or not.  And then the extra statements demonstrate through the use of the NOT operator that the boss-man realizes the entire framework is an illogical mess.

* We are not intellectuals.  We are grievers like you.  Intellectualism is emotionally irrelevant.  [Are there not academics and intellectuals who are self-aware and could more robustly tackle the grief/grieving domain?  Asking for a friend.]
* The solution to grief recovery is NOT developed through intellectual pursuit. [So we are closing down own significant domain of inquiry and self-reflection because ... well, because the "boss-man" says so ... and he knows best.]
* You have a broken heart, that is why you are reading this introduction.  We just promised to help you recover from your grief. [Does that fix a broken heart?  Of course not!  But maybe that is the spoiler alert that any modern book will tell you on the cover page (e.g., Megan Devine's book "How to carry what can't be fixed: A journal for grief")]
* Intellectuals can't help you, we can.  We have a secret sauce recipe like KFC.  Our fried chicken is guaranteed to help you recovery from the emotional pain caused by death/divorce and other losses. [Insert fine print here:  no actual guarantee, but hey, if you join our cult, the probabilities are higher.  First, you can't read the handbook alone and work through it on your own.  You need a certifiable member of our Amway network who has paid thousands of dollars to be trained in our one and true way of directing individuals to guarantee results.  Did I say guarantee again?  That is not what I meant!  Lawyers keep reminding me to avoid that word.  Success is not guaranteed, but highly probably, like 99.99999% of all cult-members who believe say it worked!  So there you go.  Nearly a guarantee on the box.  Doesn't that make you feel warm and safe.]
* Millions have used the book; no wait, now it says "hundreds of thousands".   Well, which is it?  

* The book assumes that there are "unresolved grief issues" - human cognition and dissonance does not allow such a state.  "Partially resolved" may be a fairer statement.
* PROMISE, a testimony: "we know that the actions outlined in the book will lead you to COMPLETION of the pain caused by the loss."  The "we know" continues.  [Is this sentence a word salad?  I get to unresolve my grief by COMPLETING the pain?  What does that mean?  I am utterly baffled by this statement."

Certainly, everyone would like to recover from grief and loss.  But as mentioned, just referencing the title of another book at the library, this is not a binary state of "complete mess" or "perfectly recovered."  In fact, as the womansplains much better, the grief will always be with you, and you can laugh at it sometimes, cry sometimes, teach stupid people how to approach you on the topic, do a crossword, color, paint, and write intellectual words (which I am currently doing).  If I want to learn more about the heart, I will invest more time in a female instructor and program than a male "boss-man" EVERYTIME.  I recognize that I am a CEREBRO and can learn about the HEART STRINGS more.  And my practical solution would be to learn from the female gender about such things.  That does not mean I necessarily have a LOW HEART-STRINGS IQ, it just means that I recognize who should teach such things.

SEEING THE PROBLEM:  This section is a nice synopsis of the handbook.
1. You have a broken heart [much better marketing language than boring grief or loss].
2. Death/Divorce are the big ones, mention frequently.
3. Add a meaningless statistic:  there are a total of 42 types of losses; these two plus forty others we won't mention [Fuck You "Hitchhikers guide", the answer will NEVER be 42 ... hopefully! {x:]
4. Bad shit has happened to you, so your life isn't idea and rewarding and fulfilling and perfect.  [NEWS FLASH:  No shit, is this not the purpose of life?  Read a simple parable like the seeds cast to earth: birds eat some (early death), some on the roadway many trampled and killed (a few survive), some in rocky places (a few survive), some in the briars and thorns (a few survive) and some in perfect fertile soil.  Using the rules of 5 (the true answer to the mysteries for "Hitchhiker" idiots), you have a 20% chance of being in a perfect environment for growth.  Like being born in America, you one the lottery!  Or have you?  Likely the hegemonic cUSAc inappropriately called America is the "briars and thorns".]
5. We won't say it directly, but you likely feel like shit (Regardless of the cause of your broken heart, you know how you feel, and it probably isn't good.)
6. Hypocritical oath of feelings.  "We won't tell you we know how we feel, because we don't."  You are unique, just like everyone else.  No one can understand your exact feelings.  Sympathy can only be about some shared feelings of dissimilar losses.
7. The turn (to close the sales pitch):  "We are going to tell you the actions you NEED to take to regain a sense of well-being."

FINE PRINT:  Don't read the book nonlinear.  If that is your thinking style, buck up and read it in the order we (technically just me the boss-man) demand.  If you fail to follow our rules of engagement precisely, you will also fail to recover from your grief.  Said differently, the cult leader has a very specific ritual that must be followed; if not followed you will be punished with even more grief.  So it has been written, so it shall be.  We promise a 10x solution [not full recovery, just 10x what you would do without it!  Again, someone needs a maths lesson!]  Don't take shortcuts.  Be certain to use it with a therapist that has passed the Grief{heart}Recovery [registered trademark, the heart symbol was the only way to get that registered, the "boss-man" wanted it trademarked, so more data about the narcissitic cult leader.].

Sidebar:

YES, grief matters.  A broken heart, completion/recovery sounds better than isolation/avoidance.

However, grief is a social construct based on cultural norms.  A wailing Polynesian vs the quiet Serbian with the veil symbol.  

The primary concern with this handbook is that it is using the words to manipulate the mediocre-minded into believe they are not an Amway cult.  

As men, they likely have a formulaic solution (disguised as being anti-intellectual, which likely has a very logical flow).

Since I am following the rules of reading linearly, I will maybe be found out as a charlatan or ID-10-T once more of the book is digested.

CHAPTER ONE - FINALLY
Grief: A neglected and misunderstood process 

[Developing the NEED in an impactful way!  Basic marketing persuasive frame]

Definition:  "Grief is the conflicting feelings caused by the end of or change in a familiar pattern of behavior."  [WTF?  What a nonsensical definition!]

-- interruption from friend in location 

when i feel grief, i feel stress (apocalypse / armageddon)... panic attack, pee myself, I am scared, someone walk up behind me 

tall blonde men, very tall, eat and I am taller ... raped by dogs

1828.mshaffer.com ... word grief ... 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary (First American English Dictionary?)

The pain of mind produced by loss, misfortune, injury, or evils of any kind; sorrow, regret.

* We lose a friend
* We incur a loss
* We consider ourselves injured
* By sympathy, we feel grief at the misfortunes of others 

[This definition has more meaning to me than the word salad offered by the handbook. Conflicting feelings "fear" and "freedom".]

The NT shares another teaching attributed to Jesus:  "I give you a sound mind.  Feelings of faith, NOT fear."

That is, both the New Testament (NT) of the Bible and Noah's Dictionary explains that grief is a function of the mind ...  The pain of mind vs a sound mind.

The phrase of being afraid that you will never "find someone as beautiful/as good a provider." (pg 4)  [What a pile of shit?  If you understand anything about marriage and the broken form of modern Western familial society, this "wet dream" of a perfect marriage is not latently anchored to a feeling of SHAME by the authors - if you never had the perfect love, you are a failure, feel the SHAME.  Read our book or your SHAME will grow like a CANCER in the silence.]

paper-clip 5-16

After 30 years of [being the boss-man]... pg 5

Loss of Trust.  Grief is about a broken heart, not a broken brain. [WTF?!?]
* Don't feel bad, you can have more children
* Don't feel bad, you can find another wife 

[Two over-simplified examples, that are stupid things people say, and the other book by the DEVINE female suggests making how-to cards for STUPID people.  This is such a small part of the grief process.  This handbook feels like a house of cards.]

Recovery means ... feeling better [?!?] Recovery means claiming your circumstances (rather being controlled by them).  Recovery means acquiring skills that should have been taught in your childhood (you never learned how to deal with loss directly) [another one of thise SHAME markers to get you to join the cult].

1828: recovery means retaking possession of what was lost 

[The illogic is dumbfounding.  If a sister dies in a fire, that is not recoverable in this lifetime.  The bell has been run.  The children are sleeping with the angels.  That cannot be undone.]

pg 8:  Recovery is achieved by a series of small and correct choices [Stay tuned, read our book, follow our steps religiously ... even though you have unique experiences, this is the only true path forward ... don't overthink it.... if you do, you will realize the logic is utter bullshit.]

SYNOPSIS:  We push the SHAME buttons to get you addicted to our AMWAY cult.
