The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to maximize the quality of life of patients currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). Over 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with PD and this number is expected to double by 2040. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure ? once the first Parkinsonian tremor has been detected, over 80% of the brain cells associated with creating dopamine through natural processes have already died. Dopamine is a chemical released by neurons to communicate with other nerve cells and is essential to enable the basal ganglia network to control the body?s movements. By engaging the PD patient with novel, highly-cognitive mobility exercises designed by physical therapists (PTs), automaticity can be reprogrammed to utilize different regions of the brain to control movement. Ultimately, this rewiring will slow (neuroprotection) or possibly reverse the degenerative process. Although the current technology development will focus on this one disease (PD), the technology may be applicable to other sister diseases (e.g., Alzheimer?s and Dementia) or even other conditions (traumatic brain injury, stroke, concussions, and so on). This computer-adaptive platform may eventually enable researchers to identify a biomarker that may lead to a cure for this idiopathic condition.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a prototype for an automated physical-therapy (PT) treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated prototype will act as a virtual coach encouraging patients to perform daily mobility exercises in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. This unique, automated technology will help rewire the brain of the PD patient by engaging both the mind and body which will slow the neurodegeneration inherent to PD. The system will automatically adjust the treatment protocol in terms of duration and difficulty based on the patient?s unique situation including current medication levels. Objective, technology-based outcome measures will be summarized for caregivers working with the PD patient (primary care provider, physical therapists, neurologists, and so on). In addition, this technology platform will be designed to enable community interaction among PD patients as well as facilitate tele-health communications between the PD patient and his/her healthcare provider. The overall objective is to develop a PD-specific electronic system that directs PT treatment by developing hardware/software to test the feasibility of the adaptive assessment and the automated PT treatment system.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the quality of life for the more than 1 million Americans currently suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD) while reducing the growing economic burden on the healthcare system. Outpatient physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, and mental health are key components in the treatment and management of PD. Early intervention and appropriate symptomatic management utilizing these therapies is essential for best long-term outcomes; Inadequate and infrequent treatment, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, places a heavier burden on Person with Parkinson?s (PwP) and their families and a greater financial burden on the healthcare system. Delivering remote therapies and monitoring performance via the proposed in-home therapy platform may demonstrate a reduction in symptoms or slowing of disease progression, thereby helping to reduce costly, adverse medical complications and improving the PwP quality of life. Data collected from regular in-home, daily therapies may lead to improved standards of care and aid the research community in the search for a cure. Once proven effective in the beachhead market of PD, the technology could be trialed in the mainstream markets of Alzheimer?s, Dementia, and the aging population.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a prototype for an automated therapy delivery and remote patient monitoring platform for those suffering from Parkinson?s Disease (PD). This automated platform will provide access to daily therapies for the Person with Parkinson?s (PwP) by facilitating remote therapeutic exercise and social engagement via an in-home device that monitors real-time functionality to adapt cloud based digital content to optimize physical performance, cognition, and physiological response to exercise and cognitive tasks. Such a therapeutic system should have similar levels of efficacy as in-person therapy and treatment sessions, enabling participation in the much needed therapies while simultaneously reducing the burdens placed on the PwP, their families, and the healthcare system. The subjective report data, physiological response data, and objective performance data collected throughout each session will be summarized in a report for the PwP, their families, and their caregivers or healthcare providers to improve the continued delivery of treatment, clinical decision making, and health and safety of the patient. This proposed technology will help to reduce the effects of isolation, provide access to physical therapy and exercise treatments and improve the remote monitoring of patients throughout the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and beyond.
