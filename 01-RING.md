| Carla: |   Hello?   | 
| Lana: |   Carla, it's 4:05PM and your children are still here at the Church [^2].  You know the rules.  | 
| Carla:    |  Hi Lana [^3].  Thanks for letting me know.  David was supposed to pick them up at 4.  Is he not there yet?   | 
| Lana: |  Would I be calling if he was here!   | 
| Carla: |   You're right, sorry.  I can pick them up in a few minutes when Warren's mom shows up.  I just put Kandie down for a nap.   | 
| Lana: |   Do you think I want to hear your life story?  You know the rules.  The primary program is a benefit to you and your children, but they must be picked up by 4PM.  It is now 4:06 and you are no closer to getting here.   | 
| Carla: |   But, I can't leave the house yet.  | 
| Lana: |  I will not repeat myself.  If you are not here by 4:15PM, your children won't participate in this afterschool program again.  Do you hear me!   |

| Lana: |  Ed, where are you?   | 
| Ed: |  I have a fire call!  Out on Tamarack Lane.  It may be the Shaffer home.   | 
| Lana: |  Carla's house is on fire?!?  I just got off the phone with her.  She was late picking up the oldest kids from primary.   | 
| Ed (exasperated): |  Lana, what did you do?   | 

###(Awkward Pause)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Ed (decisive): |  It doesn't matter now.  But you should probably follow me to the house in your car.  The kids shouldn't be there.  Maybe take them to the Kiser's.  I got to go.  Like Now! |

###(SHAFFER HOME, 4:16PM)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Carla: |   Dear God! Oh no!  There is smoke coming from the house.  Michael, you go try and find the hose and get it primed for water.  Girls, you need to stay in the car.  Keep down and out of sight.  | 
| Carla: |   Monte, can you hear me?  Where are you?   | 
| Monte: |   Mama, YES, I can hear you.  Please help me, I am stuck.  My feet and neck hurt a lot if I move.  They are tingly. | 
| Carla: |   Thank God!  Monte, I need to break the glass to get in.  Don't be alarmed.  I am here. (sound of shattering glass) Monte, where are you? | 
| Monte: |   Over here.  I am trapped under blankets/clothes.  The tingly pain is less under the blankets.   Please help. | 
| Carla: |   (seeing sparks and a pool of water on the floor)|
| Carla: |   Michael.  Kink the hose to stop the water until I say.  Then pull the hose out of the garage. |
| Carla: |   (finding  the main circuit breaker for house; turning it off) Monte, are you hurt? |
| Monte: |   (wheezing)  Not really.  I was able to breath through a small opening.  The clothes/blankets protected me from the tingly pain.  I can't get out.  I am still trapped.  I need help. |
| Carla: |   (moving aside fallen bookshelf; moving blankets off of Monte, wrapping towel around her own arm) Monte, where is Warren? |
| Monte: |   Mama, you are bleeding. | 
| Carla: |   I will be fine.  Where is Warren? |
| Monte: |   Warren is there (pointing to the right).  He must be sleeping.  When I grabbed his hand, I felt a strong shock in my right palm.  That is when the tingling pain began. |

| :---------------- | :------  | 
| Carla: |   (seeing Warren).  Okay, Monte.  Let's go.  I will come back for Warren.  |
| Monte: |   Mama, we can't leave Warren.  There is smoke and fire nearby.  We have to help him now. | 
| Carla: |   (maternal palm-cheek hug).  Monte.  Listen carefully.  Warren is sleeping.  Warren is sleeping with the angels.  Warren will not wake up right now.  He will go live with Jesus in Heaven.  Do you hear me son? (she picks up Monte and takes him to stairwell)|
| Monte: |   (crying) Mama, I don't want Warren to go.  He is my best friend.  Can't we help him somehow? | 
| Carla: |   (strong grasp of Monte's hand).  Monte, I wish we could help him.  But Warren is already sleeping with the angels.  God loves him.  He will be OK.  Now listen, I need to go check on Kandie.|
| Monte: |   Mama, Kandie was having a normal nap.  She isn't sleeping with the angels is she? | 
| Carla: |   (caressing Monte's cowlick on the back of his head).  I hope she is taking a normal nap.  But I need to find out.  Please listen carefully.  Stay right here, do NOT move until I come back and get you.  Do you understand?|
| Monte: |   YES, Mama. | 


###(SHAFFER HOME, 4:22PM)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Carla: |   Michael.  Turn on the water and shoot the hose towards Kandie's room.  I need to go get her. |


###(SHAFFER HOME, 4:28PM)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Volunteer Firefighter #1: |   Sorry ma'am.  I can't let you go in the house. (Carla tries to race past him, but he clutches her in a big bear hug.  Carla is forced away from the house towards the street where she sees Lana signaling to her). |


###(SHAFFER HOME, 4:30PM)
| Person | Dialogue |
| :---------------- | :------  |
| Lana: |   Carla.  I came to get your children and get them away from this scene.  No child should ever have to see this.  Your girls are in the car.  I called for Monte, but he would not come.  And Michael has already been seen by others, so he should probably stay here.  Maybe I take the girls over to Louise Kiser's.  Is that OK? |
| Carla: |   Just Go!  (Carla sits on the ground and begins sobbing.  Her calm fortitude has yielded to the realities of the situation:  age 28, she barely was able to save her fifth child and because of 'firefighters' and their safety requirements, her sixth child will likely sleep with the angels like Warren.) |




[^1]: The call was likely a connection on a party line.  How the connection was actually made, and which parties were listening are uncertain.  The call will be framed after the minutiae of the connection is executed.


[^2]: The congregation of the Mormon Church ("local branch") met in a small building near the Flathead River (now the Glacier Church of Christ: 1203 2nd Ave W, Columbia Falls, MT 59912), about 3 miles from the Shaffer residence at 1610 Tamarack Ln, Columbia Falls, MT 59912.

 

[^3]: Lana Toren represents a busy-body personality type.  A rule follower, a stickler for rules.  Conveniently, LANA is an anagram for ANAL, as in the "anal retentive" personality class.  In Hebrew, the "Torah" represents the written word of God (Tor = papyrus, YAH = God), so "Toren" would represent the written rules of men based on their understanding of God's word.  In Hebrew, Lana Toren would mean basically "the light of the written rules" and her son Derek Toren would mean "the way of the written rules".  Institutions interpret God's word and create policies, procedures, and rituals; that is, by definition, the philosophies of men (and women) mingled with scripture.
