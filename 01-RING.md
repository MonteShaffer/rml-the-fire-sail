| Carla: |   Hello?   | 
| Lana: |   Carla, it's 4:05PM and your children are still here at the Church [^2].   | 
| Carla:    |  Hi Lana [^3].  Thanks for letting me know.  David was supposed to pick them up at 4.  Is he not there yet?   | 
| Lana: |  Would I be calling if he was here!   | 
| Carla: |   You're right, sorry.  I can pick them up in a few minutes when Warren's mom shows up.  I just put Kandie down for a nap.   | 
| Lana: |   Do you think I want to hear your life story?  You know the rules.  The primary program is a benefit to you and your children, but they must be picked up by 4PM.  It is now 4:06 and you are no closer to getting here.   | 
| Carla: |   But, I can't leave the house yet.  | 
| Lana: |  I will not repeat myself.  If you are not here by 4:15PM, your children won't participate in this afterschool program again.  Do you hear me!   |

| Lana: |  Ed, where are you?   | 
| Ed: |  I have a call!  There's a housefire out on Tamarack Lane.  It may be the Shaffer home.   | 
| Lana: |  Carla's house is on fire?!?  I just got off the phone with her.  She was late picking up the oldest kids from primary.   | 
| Ed (exasperated): |  Lana, what did you do?   | 







[^1]: The call was likely a connection on a party line.  How the connection was actually made, and which parties were listening are uncertain.  The call will be framed after the minutiae of the connection is executed.


[^2] The congregation of the Mormon Church ("local branch") met in a small building near the Flathead River (now the Glacier Church of Christ: 1203 2nd Ave W, Columbia Falls, MT 59912), about 3 miles from the Shaffer residence at 1610 Tamarack Ln, Columbia Falls, MT 59912.

 

[^3]: Lana Toren represents a busy-body personality type.  A rule follower, a stickler for rules.  Conveniently, LANA is an anagram for ANAL, as in the "anal retentive" personality class.  In Hebrew, the "Torah" represents the written word of God (Tor = papyrus, YAH = God), so "Toren" would represent the written rules of men based on their understanding of God's word.  In Hebrew, Lana Toren would mean basically "the light of the written rules" and her son Derek Toren would mean "the way of the written rules".  Institutions interpret God's word and create policies, procedures, and rituals; that is, by definition, the philosophies of men (and women) mingled with scripture.
